# LiquidIceStudios_Hurl4
This is the git repo for my Liquid Ice Studios application assignment. We got the assignment to create a "connect 4" game. I tried to make it a bit more interesting by making it a physics based game where you have to hurl the pieces into the board to try and connect four.

# Controls
The controls are very simple:
- Player 1 (Sits to the LEFT of the keyboard): A & D to rotate the disc. Hold W to power up and release W to throw disc
- Player 2 (Sits to the RIGHT of the keyboard): Left Arrow & Right Arrow to rotate the disc. Hold Up Arrow to power up and release Up Arrow to throw disc

# Features
- Local Co-op gameplay (1 Keyboard)
- Physics based Connect 4
- 2 Unique levels to coose and pick from
- Bouncy pads to make the levels and gameplay a tiny bit more *spicy*
- Guaranteerd fun if played in combination with some good friends (and banter)
